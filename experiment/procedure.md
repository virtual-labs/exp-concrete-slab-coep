## PROCEDURE

- Enter the larger(Ly) and smaller(Lx) dimensions of slab in mm.

- If Ly/Lx is greater than 2, then the slab will be designed as a one way slab.

- Select the grade of concrete (f<sub>ck</sub>) in MPa.

- Select the grade of steel (f<sub>y</sub>) in MPa.

- In the next level, select the depth of slab (D) in mm

- Calculate the effective depth of slab in m by deducting the cover.

- Enter the span of slab L in m.

- Enter the width of support in m.

- Calculate L<sub>eff</sub> in m. After three incorrect attempts, correct formula and value will be displayed.

- Enter the load on slab (w)

- Calculate the load in KN/m (W). After three incorrect attempts, correct formula and value will be displayed.

- Calculate the factored load (Wu).

- In the next step, calculate the bending moment (Mu) in Nmm, considering a simply supported span. After three incorrect attempts, correct formula and value will be displayed.

- Calculate Area of steel (Ast) in mm<sup>2</sup>

- Minimum Ast will be calculated and compared with our calculated Ast. The maximum value will be considered.

- Select the bar diameter in mm.

- Spacing will be calculated in mm
